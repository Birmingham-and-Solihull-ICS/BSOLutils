# BSOLutils

This repository contains an R package with various helper functions for
things like confidence intervals, measures of dispersion,
standardisation and other functions.

Install from GitHub as:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/Birmingham-and-Solihull-ICS/BSOLutils", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Please also consider the following:

- Linting your code. This is a formatting process that follows a rule
  set. We broadly encourage the tidyverse standard, and recommend the
  `lintr` package.
- Comment your code to make sure others can follow.
- Consider your naming conventions: we recommend `snake case` where
  spaces are replaced by underscores and no capitals are use. E.g.
  `outpatient_referral_data`
